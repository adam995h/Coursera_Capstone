The key outputs of the work are two maps of Toronto. One shows the density of all restaurants in a 500m radius of each postcode.
This uses the postcode page on Wikipedia:
'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M'
Foursquare is used in search mode to return all restaurants within the radius of the postcode. Folium is then used to vislualise the
density of restaurants. 

A new data frame is then generated that drops duplicates (as some postcodes are within 500m of each other). This data frame then selects
just the pizza restaurants. This data frame is then extended using Foursquare to inlcude the longitude and latitude of each pizza
restaurant as well as the rating and price tier.

The result is a detailed frame of 101 pizza resturants across Toronto. This data is then used to produce a second interactive map using 
Folium. The markers now represent pizza restaurant locations and are colour coded for rating. The exception is that restaurants in price
tier 2 are blue. This interactive map provides a way of exploring where the Greenfield and Displace models of disruption might work.
